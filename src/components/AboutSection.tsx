            With over 10 years of experience building scalable, AI-powered EdTech products, I specialize in crafting impactful learning solutions that work across diverse geographies, languages, and constraints. My expertise lies at the intersection of <span className="font-semibold text-black">product strategy, localization, AI integration, and cross-functional execution</span>.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            At Educational Initiatives, I've led the end-to-end development of adaptive learning platforms used by K–10 students across India, South Africa, and the UAE. I launched core AI-driven features like the <span className="font-semibold text-black">Teacher Copilot and Socratic Hint Engine</span>, resulting in measurable improvements such as a <span className="font-semibold text-black">40% reduction in support dependency and a 25% drop in student guesswork</span>.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I've successfully driven multi-language localization efforts, delivering contextualized content across <span className="font-semibold text-black">9 Indian languages and 3 global regions</span>, ensuring accessibility without compromising user experience or backend performance.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            One of my most meaningful contributions was launching an <span className="font-semibold text-black">offline-ready platform in South Africa</span>, designed to work in bandwidth-constrained classrooms. This not only improved student access but also unlocked <span className="font-semibold text-black">₹5 Cr+ in new revenue</span> and long-term partnerships in the region.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I've also led LMS integrations via API for global education foundations, balancing product flexibility with the requirements of scale, privacy, and interoperability.

          <p>
            As a <span className="font-semibold text-black">certified SAFe Agilist</span>, I bring structure to agile squads while ensuring every feature we ship reflects real classroom realities, data-informed insights, and a bias for measurable impact.
