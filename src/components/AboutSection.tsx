            I'm Aman. Senior Product Manager at Educational Initiatives, based in Ahmedabad.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong className="text-black">Here's what I actually do:</strong> I take complex educational challenges and transform them into intuitive product solutions. 
            Not just "user-friendly" interfaces - products that actually drive learning outcomes while scaling to millions of users.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Most product managers can't code. Most developers can't understand pedagogy. I do both. While 
            others debate features, I'm shipping data-driven solutions that improve educational experiences. 
            International market expansion isn't optional, it's essential.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I've built products used by 2M+ students across 15 countries because I actually 
            understand what works. My experience with Mindspark, Mira, and Navigator proves it.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The result? Products that don't just engage learners - they accelerate their progress.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-orange-600 underline cursor-pointer hover:text-orange-700">
            I also write about product management, EdTech, and everything in between.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            When I'm not building products, I'm mentoring other PMs or exploring new educational technologies. 
            Strong coffee, always.

            I don't just build products. I build products that work.
