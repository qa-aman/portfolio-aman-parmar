        <div className="space-y-6 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          <p>With over 10 years of experience building scalable, AI-powered EdTech products, I specialize in crafting impactful learning solutions that work across diverse geographies, languages, and constraints. My expertise lies at the intersection of product strategy, localization, AI integration, and cross-functional execution.</p>
          
          <p>At Educational Initiatives, I've led the end-to-end development of adaptive learning platforms used by Kâ€“10 students across India, South Africa, and the UAE. I launched core AI-driven features like the Teacher Copilot and Socratic Hint Engine, resulting in measurable improvements such as a 40% reduction in support dependency and a 25% drop in student guesswork.</p>
          
          <p>I've successfully driven multi-language localization efforts, delivering contextualized content across 9 Indian languages and 3 global regions, ensuring accessibility without compromising user experience or backend performance.</p>
          
          <p>
            With a data-informed and documentation-driven approach, I focus on long-term scalability and user satisfaction while exploring advancements in AI-powered learning and analytics to shape the future of global EdTech innovation.
          </p>
          
          <p className="font-medium text-black">I've also led LMS integrations via API for global education foundations, balancing product flexibility with the requirements of scale, privacy, and interoperability.</p>
