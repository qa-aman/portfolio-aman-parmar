          <p>
            As a Senior Product Manager at Educational Initiatives, I bring over three years of experience in leading the end-to-end lifecycle of impactful EdTech products, including CRM transformations and adaptive learning platforms.

          <p>
            My expertise lies in defining product strategy, conducting user research, and delivering scalable, offline-resilient solutions that address real-world challenges in education. Recent projects include spearheading the CRM redesign and driving architectural enhancements for the Mira learning application to ensure a seamless, user-focused experience across diverse geographies.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Guided by a mission to enable personalized learning at scale, I collaborate closely with cross-functional teams to localize solutions for international markets, optimize workflows, and align product development with organizational goals.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            With a data-informed and documentation-driven approach, I focus on long-term scalability and user satisfaction while exploring advancements in AI-powered learning and analytics to shape the future of global EdTech innovation.

          <p className="text-orange-600 underline cursor-pointer hover:text-orange-700">
            I also write about product management, EdTech, and everything in between.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            When I'm not building products, I'm mentoring other PMs or exploring new educational technologies. 
            Strong coffee, always.

            I don't just build products. I build products that work.
